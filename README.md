# Microindentation-Analyzer
A code to streamline processing results from Knoop and Vickers microindentation tests.

 - This code is designed to function in the 2024 version of MATLAB. It may not work as intended in other versions
 - This requires the installation of MATLAB's Computer Vision Toolbox, Deep Learning Toolbox, and Webcam Support Package

 - Knoop indents are most easily detected when the long diagonal is as close to horizontal as possible (view images in "ReadMe References" file for reference). This can be done with the built-in image rotation slider.
 - Vickers indent edges are most consistently found when the diagonals between endpoints are horizontal and vertical (view images in "ReadMe References" file for reference)
 - The following video goes over the basic functionalities of this program.
