# Microindentation-Analyzer
A code to streamline processing results from Knoop and Vickers microindentation tests.

 - This code is designed to function in the 2024 version of MATLAB. It may not work as intended in other versions.
 - The WHOLE "Indent Identifier" folder must be downloaded for the program to work as intended, as it references files within that folder.
 - This requires the installation of MATLAB's Computer Vision Toolbox, Deep Learning Toolbox, and Webcam Support Package
(https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45182-matlab-support-package-for-usb-webcams).
 - Ensure that your current file directory in MATLAB is the "Indent Identifier" folder whenever running this program.
 - Knoop indents are most easily detected when the long diagonal is as close to horizontal as possible (view images in "ReadMe References" file for reference). This can be done with the built-in image rotation slider.
 - Vickers indent edges are most consistently found when the diagonals between endpoints are horizontal and vertical (view images in "ReadMe References" file for reference)
 - The following video goes over the basic functionalities of this program.
